# BLE-ESP32-tracking-robot
BLE robot that tracks your cell phone signal (kindoff)
510 / 5000
In this project we design and build a robot that uses BLE as a communication method. The user through an APP created with MIT inventor sends the RSSI to the ESP32. The robot is able to move and "find" the user who uses said app, autonomously, thanks to the fact that we can measure the signal from the cell phone. The project was developed on both Arduino IDE and MIT app Inventor platforms based on an ESP32 microcontroller. As part of the slogan, the robot had to be built with recyclable materials.
